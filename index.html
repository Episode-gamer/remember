    <p>"And who are you", the proud lord said</p>
    <p>""That I must bow so low?"</p>
    <p>"Only a cat of a different coat</p>
    <p>"That's all the truth I know</p>
    <p>"In a coat of gold or a coat of red</p>

    <p>"That lord of Castamere</p>
    <p>"But now the rains weep o'er his hall</p>
    <p>"With no one there to hear</p>
