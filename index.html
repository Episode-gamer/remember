    <p>"And who are you", the proud lord said\n"That I must bow so low?"\nOnly a cat of a different coat\nThat's all the truth I know\nIn a coat of gold or a coat of red\nA lion still has claws\nAnd mine are long and sharp, my lord\nAs long and sharp as yours\n\nAnd so he spoke, and so he spoke\nThat lord of Castamere\nBut now the rains weep o'er his hall\nWith no one there to hear\nYes, now the rains weep o'er his hall\nAnd not a soul to hear</p>
